jadno
=====

Jadno is currently a work in progress clone of the classic card game Uno.
It is currently being built using Python with the Kivy framework for it's
excellent multiplatform touch support. Currently the game is just barely
functional but is being actively developed. I hope to branch off from the
original Uno rules at some point to include my own twist but one step at
a time.
